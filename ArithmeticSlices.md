Arithmetic Slices

Recursive Defintion

The recursive definition for this problem is findidn gthe amount of substring that each elemnt in those substring that each element in those substrings differ consecutively form their adjacent elements. Iths best to start form the smallest substring you can which must contain three elemetns so starting the soluitions at 1=2 seems very appropiate. 

Storing Solutions

My intention is to store the solutions for this problem by counting the length of my array and incrementing bases on how many consecutive differences I had found and by the size of the array.
